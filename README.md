This is the UI to my Soccer App that allows users to sign up for pickup games in Chicago or schedule their own. To do, a user must create an account and then they can see all of the games happening in the community. Make sure you have VueJS and NPM installed in your machine. Then clone this repo to your local folder and type in the following to the command line: `npm run serve`. You also need to have the backend repo cloned to your local folder (you can find that here: `https://github.com/ernestomelchor/capstone_backend`). Once the backend and frontend repo are both cloned to your local folder, and you run `npm run serve` in frontend repo inside the terminal, visit `localhost:8080` in your browser to view the full app.
